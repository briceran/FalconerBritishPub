Q: What does a search engine do?
--------------------------------
A: A search engine (Google PageRank) consists of proprietary ranking algorithms.  These algorithms scrape data from websites and assemble a database of 'elements'.  Elements consist of {keywords, headers, titles, images, hyperlinks}. This database is then organized and analyzed - eventually leading to a unique RANK for each website.  The HOW of this process, or data pipeline, is what these companies patent.
=====================================


One of the main goals of a ranking algorithm is determining webpage POPULARITY.  (Something that would be incredibly hard to judge without the help of software)Think about how you would respond if your employer asked you: "Which of the following search engines is the most popular? Yahoo, Bing, or Google?"

It might be easy for you to say that Google Search is used by most of your friends - "Surely, nobody uses 'AskJeeves' anymore..."

But, when it comes down to it, supporting your answer with data (statistics) would be pretty difficult...  Are you going to start polling your friends and make a population estimate based on your sample?  Maybe, or maybe you just don't care!

==========================================
Q: What do the search engines care about?
-------------------------------------
A:
--------------------
+ Presence/absence of certain features
+ How the webpage is organized (easy to read OR meant for a computer)
+ Content (journal article OR trash)
+ Popularity
--------------------

* The absence of certain features or the over-prevalence of others can effect your PageRank.

=====================================
Q: What distinguished Google, from, say, Yahoo and Bing?
A: Different Engines are after Different Things!
-------------------------
"SEV shows you which site elements are particularly important to the various engines and helps you position your website for those engines' ranking criteria"

* This is likely based on the specifics of ranking algorithm implementation (What distinguishes Google Search from Yahoo Search).

=======================================
Q: Will my website be ranked highly in the search engines if I use 'SEV V1'?
A: No.  No guarantees are made by www.GoDaddy.com. SEV does not guarantee search engine listings or higher rankings.  Also, SEV cannot provide any exact timeline for the FRUITION of your SEO efforts.  Competition is fierce - there is no guarantee that your URL will attain a high rank with a particular search engine.  The ultimate decision lies entirely with the search engine.

Caveat: However...

Like any good parent playing favorites, the child with the best behavior gets rewarded the most...  with better treats. "The early bird gets the worm!"
===============================================
Search engines reward sites that are optimized, well-composed, and feature unique and/or meaningful content.  That's where SEV comes in handy.

=============================================
Q: Can I pay for guaranteed search engine listing?

A: Yes, in some cases.  A number of search engines support paid-inclusion models for Web content.  Paid inclusion generally guarantees a shorter turnaround time for submitted pages and in some cases also provides guaranteed inclusion.

==============================================
Q: What are Keywords? Why Do I need them?

A: Search engines use keywords when they include your website in their search results.  They can make or break your search engine ranking.  Even adding keywords to the content of your website can improve its ranking.In the same light, overuse can cause harm and even cause your site to be BANNED for spamming.
================================================
